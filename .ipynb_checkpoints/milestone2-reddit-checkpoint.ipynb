It is understandable thought that you would not get it since you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase \"Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.\n",

He is a very fragile kid, even discounting his experiences in the Upside Down. He's still very broken up about his father leaving without having the coping mechanism that Jonathan has in his anger, not that that's positive. If Hopper has one flame up with Will, that's it for him. Will would shut him out and after everything, I doubt Joyce would be okay dating Hopper in a situation Will wasn't comfortable with.

      "Now the thing is, the cast was intentionally keeping will in the dark on account of the fact that he was a spy. Acting on the assumption that when will finds out where they are, the shadow monster will as well. This is later proven to be correct when the shadow monster does indeed figure out where they are and sends demo dogs to attack.\n",

      "\n",
      "The same goes for the doctor. He has a huge unknown timeline in which he could have been assaulted beginning literally from when will and co left the lab. Giving him the benefit of the doubt let’s assume he was attacked relatively recently to hopper and el’s return. \n",
      "\n",
      "Still even at this point, the shadow monster has no intense drive to protect the gate, because the gate is not under attack. Certainly not to the point of leaving a hostile under attack alive. Also, they hadn’t set the central area on fire at this point. That doesn’t happen until after hopper reaches the original site, where he looks at the demo dogs with a knife.\n",
